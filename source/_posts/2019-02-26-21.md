You know what this is? It's my badge for getting my first project into Maven Central. [This one](https://github.com/slothsoft/framework-random), but it doesn't really matter. What matters that it took way too much nerve to get this far. I feel like I've lost 20 years of my life. So I'm gonna wear my  badge with pride.
