I don't know if I'm taking on too much here, but I'm trying to get [maven-php-plugin](https://github.com/php-maven/maven-php-plugin) to work again (because I want it for my [WordPress plug-in](https://github.com/slothsoft/wordpress-github-repositories). This is the GitHub repository: [maven-php-plugin](https://github.com/slothsoft/maven-php-plugin)

Just in a couple of days I found a lot of awesome GitHub features. [Projects were one](https://github.com/users/slothsoft/projects/1). 

<!-- more --> 

Tasks are another one. They are added to issues and appear on the issue overview like this:

And a third (and maybe the greatest one) is the Travis integration:

Not only does the issue show all its commits, it shows which commits broke the build (and after which the build still worked). Awesome for debugging! I love it. ❤

The last two features can be viewed on [issue #5](https://github.com/slothsoft/maven-php-plugin/issues/5), if you are interested.
