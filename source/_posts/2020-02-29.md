I created a really simple application based on the [Eclipse Example Application](https://github.com/slothsoft/example-eclipse-application) that is able to split MP4 Videos at their chapter markers.

While the application itself is small (and maybe only useful for me and my friends), I tried to create it as professionally as possible, so it has:

- a [user manual](https://slothsoft.github.io/mp4-spliterator/)
- a [developer guide](https://github.com/slothsoft/mp4-spliterator/wiki)
- a [test plan](https://github.com/slothsoft/mp4-spliterator/wiki/Test-Plan)
- tests of all necessary phases (unit, integration, acceptance)
- a [CI server](https://www.travis-ci.com/slothsoft/mp4-spliterator)
