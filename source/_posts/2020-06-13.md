Whenever I get addicted to a game, I inevitably start wondering if I can create mods for the game.<!-- more --> Sometimes it's possible, sometimes not. So the last couple of months I tried:

- [Stardew Valley New Recipes Marker](https://github.com/slothsoft/stardew-new-recipes-marker)  - this one works for me but is not good enough to publish due to technical limitations
- [Scrap Mechanic Scripts](https://github.com/slothsoft/scrap-mechanic-scripts) - not sure how and if you can create mods in Scrap Mechanic, but at least I used these tweaks to make the game more balanced (for me)
