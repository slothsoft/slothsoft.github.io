Today I had a bit of time on my hands, so I redesigned this site. It consists now of static HTML generated by [Hexo](https://hexo.io), which I hope is easier to maintain than the WordPress site.

I also use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for deploying the website, and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for hosting it.
