I hate JavaFX now. In the past I liked it, because I liked the design and everything about it. Now with Java 11 it's so ridiculous hard to build an application, that I'll just stop doing it. However... I updated the JavaFX / Maven Example:

I think the only fun part here is that the branches for Java 7 and Java 8 are still present. But that's just me.
