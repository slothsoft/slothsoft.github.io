Before all this started, I had an Eclipse repository with 3 (or so) plug-ins. I hated most of them. And even with that few plug-ins I learned why it's a good idea to have one repository per plug-in: issues and commits where scrambled, and the lifecycle did not work at all. 

<!-- more --> 

So I cleaned it all up. Deleted all but one plug-in. Made it work even better with Tycho. And separated the update site. 

Problem is: I did not get Tycho to release the plug-in, even though it should work. (-> [Issue #15](https://github.com/slothsoft/eclipse-builder-pattern/issues/15)) On the side of the update side there are no categories anymore. (-> [Issue #2](https://github.com/slothsoft/eclipse-update-site/issues/2))  Both was deemed "good enough" for now, since even the internet can't help my any more.

So, here it is:

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/slothsoft/eclipse-builder-pattern)
- [Update Site](https://github.com/slothsoft/eclipse-update-site)
