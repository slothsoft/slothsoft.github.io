I finally finished the code challenges of Advent of Code *2021*. I was really, _really_ stuck on [day 22](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/22), but I'm glad I kept at it. [Here](https://github.com/slothsoft/advent-of-code/tree/main/2021/src/test/java/d22) is my solution.

And this is my calender for that year, which is a lot more colorful than {% post_link 2023-01-02 '2022' %}:
