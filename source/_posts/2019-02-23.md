Ten minutes later I had started a enormous refactoring on one project that didn't really need one. I even tackled the problem of "deploying to Maven Central".  Now I've finished the project and am ready to deploy... but for some reason I'm still getting exceptions. All clues point to the fact that I'm not at fault.
