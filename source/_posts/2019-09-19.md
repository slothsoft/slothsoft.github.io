A lot happened the last couple months, I just forgot to mention it. 

<!-- more --> 

I started dabbling with web stuff. JavaScript, HTML, NodeJS, ... all that good stuff. The most shocking thing I learned is that nobody uses JavaScript professionally. Some might create professional (looking) websites, but nobody uses it professionally. Not even my own company. 

For my very first projects I created some bots. Shmotbots to be exact. If you want to know what that is, you need to check out the [Discord Shmotbot](https://github.com/slothsoft/discord-shmotbot)  and / or the [Slack Shmotbot](https://github.com/slothsoft/slack-shmotbot).

Then I tried setting up a professional environment. That's how I learned that nobody does it. You can see my process in the [JavaScript example](https://github.com/slothsoft/example-javascript-website). Spoiler: In the end it worked nicely. I'm pretty proud.

Afterwards I was ready to tackle some [programming exercises](https://github.com/slothsoft/exercises-javascript). I plan to give some of these to my trainees at work.

Finally I created my first npm module [qunit-reporter](https://github.com/slothsoft/qunit-reporter), which surprisingly is a module to generate reports from QUnit.  

So I kept bussy. I learned a lot. I really hate JavaScript. But I like having webapps that run everywhere instead of whatever Java is doing right now, so I think I'll manage. Someday. Maybe.
