While there seem to be a couple of projects that use Eclipse as a framework to deploy applications, there are very little that use actual target platforms for some reason. Most want you to download and install a custom Eclipse just to deploy a specific snapshot of their application (example: [DBeaver](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Develop-in-Eclipse)).

I personally want to have a nice, reproducable build that uses the same code in my IDE as while packaging JARs, so I created an example application using a target platform file: [example-eclipse-application](https://github.com/slothsoft/example-eclipse-application) 

I even managed to use plain Maven dependencies (even if they're not OSGi bundles) in that reactor! 

(This showed a couple of bugs with the Random and Charts Frameworks, but I guess that's life.  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`)
