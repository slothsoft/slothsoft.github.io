Over the holidays I had a couple of hours and started a Java project to displays charts. The end goal is to display electropherogram, but it's going to be a long bumpy road until I get there.

I'm really proud of what I did however, so check out the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/slothsoft/charts). Some of the awesome stuff I'm actually proud of is the [JavaDoc](https://slothsoft.github.io/charts/), the [Code Coverage](https://slothsoft.github.io/charts/coverage/) and the [Wiki](https://github.com/slothsoft/charts/wiki).

Right now the API can display charts like these:
