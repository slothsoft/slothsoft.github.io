So I got bored and decided I want to see if I can create a plug-in for WordPress (this page previously ran on WordPress). So I did. <!-- more --> It was pretty easy actually. So I tried to get it to WordPress's release repository. Same. So...

- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/slothsoft/wordpress-github-repositories)
- [WordPress Plug-in](https://wordpress.org/plugins/list-github-repositories/)
