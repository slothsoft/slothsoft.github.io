My colleagues have their own leaderboard for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). That's how I learned of this code challenge, and this year I want to be part of it. Not competitive, but just for fun.

I've collected my doings in [this repository](https://github.com/slothsoft/advent-of-code), but it might be private until the end of December.
